# aframe-starters
This repo contains mini-projects made using A-Frame. Interns build these projects in the first week of their A-Frame VR internship.

# Directory structure
To add a new project, create a directory with the following structure:
```
- ProjectName/
  - Code/  - should contain the codebase
  - Documents/  - should contain designs and writeups
  - README.md
```
# Commit Guidelines
- commit message should not be in continuous tense.
- It should start from a key word *ADD, UPDATE, REMOVE, FIX*. For example: `ADD - README.md` when a readme file is added. `UPDATE - added new project to README` when something new is added to existing readme file.
