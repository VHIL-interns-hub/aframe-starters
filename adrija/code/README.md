## SOLAR SYSTEM-


### About the project-
Building a solar system using AFRAME components and javascript. User can navigate through planets and click on them to read information about them. **This solar system is not scalable.**

### Scope of project-
After scaling the proportions of the planets relative to each other, (according to scientific accuracy) this can be used for educational purposes for children. They can learn about solar system using VR headsets.

### System Requirements-
* Web browser supporting webVR
#### How to execute the program-
* Open the html file in a web browser.
* Drag and explore the scene using mouse.
* Press ENTER to play/pause movement
* Click on planets to read about their information.

### Future work-
* Beautify information display by replacing alert box with a plane where the relevant text will be loaded
* Add orbital rings to make revolutions of planet more visually pleasing and understandable.
